## Getting Started with Jaspr UI

Implementing Jaspr UI in your project involves a systematic approach that seamlessly integrates powerful UI components into your web application. This guide will walk you through the essential steps of setting up and utilizing Jaspr UI effectively.

### Step 1: Dependency Installation

Integrating Jaspr UI begins with adding the library to your project's dependencies. You have two primary methods of installation:

#### Standard Package Installation

When using the official published package, update your `pubspec.yaml` with:

```yaml
dependencies:
  jaspr_ui: ^1.0.0
```

#### Git Repository Installation

For developers wanting the latest development version, you can reference the GitHub repository directly:

```yaml
dependencies:
  jaspr_ui:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/anoochit/jaspr_ui.git
      ref: daisyui # Specify the branch you want to use
```

### Step 2: Stylesheet and Styling Configuration

To ensure your application has the necessary styling, incorporate the required CSS frameworks and stylesheets:

```dart
runApp(Document(
  lang: 'en',
  title: 'Your Application',
  head: daisyUiStyles,  // Includes Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI styles
  body: App(),
));
```

### Step 3: Application Component Setup

Configure your main application component to leverage Jaspr UI's routing and theming capabilities:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr/jaspr.dart';
import 'package:jaspr_router/jaspr_router.dart';
import 'package:jaspr_ui/jaspr_ui.dart';

import 'pages/home.dart';

class App extends StatelessComponent {
  const App({super.key});

  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield DaisyUI(
      theme: 'dark',  // Choose between light and dark themes
      routes: [
        Route(
          path: '/',
          title: 'Home',
          builder: (context, state) => const Home(),
        )
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Component Implementation

Demonstrate component usage in your page implementations. Here's an example of integrating a gradient title component:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr/jaspr.dart';
import 'package:jaspr_ui/jaspr_ui.dart';

@client
class Home extends StatefulComponent {
  const Home({super.key});

  @override
  State<Home> createState() => HomeState();
}

class HomeState extends State<Home> {
  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield TitleGradient(
      title: 'Welcome to Our Dynamic Web Application',
    );
  }
}
```

## Best Practices and Recommendations

1. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update your Jaspr UI dependency to access the latest features and bug fixes.

2. **Theme Customization**: Experiment with different themes to match your application's design language.

3. **Responsive Design**: Leverage Tailwind CSS's utility classes to create responsive layouts.

4. **Performance**: Minimize unnecessary component renders and optimize your application's performance.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
- Verify CDN stylesheet loading
- Check browser console for any configuration warnings

By following these steps, you'll be well-equipped to integrate Jaspr UI into your web application, creating dynamic and visually appealing interfaces with ease.
